# Samples for jbang.dev/try

This directory contains samples for the jbang.dev/try page.

## How to add a sample

1. Add the sample to the `samples` directory
2. Add the sample to the `trysamples.yml` file
3. Test the sample by running `mise preview` and navigating to http://localhost:8080/try/ and pick it from the list.

Open for any kind of new sample or updates to existing samples - just keep them short and educational without 
too massive dependency chains as it makes the execution slow/hard on MyBinder.org.
