I really did not want to do this, but after I and others tried to convince google-java-format https://github.com/google/google-java-format/issues/1218[one] https://github.com/google/google-java-format/issues/1218[too] https://github.com/google/google-java-format/issues/1215[many] times to not mess with JBang directives like `//DEPS` or the `///usr/bin/env` lines, I finally gave up and made my own.

Tools like Spotless (which I love!) are still a bit too clunky to use on the command line, forcing my hand to move - all in hope this will be adopted by others and make itself irrelevant.

So here it is: https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-fmt

## Why jbang-fmt?

- **Simple**: One command to format any Java file or directory
- **Fast**: Built for command-line usage
- **Flexible**: All the options you need (but probably shouldn't use)
- **JBang-aware**: Respects `//DEPS` and `///usr/bin/env` directives

It is a simple tool that formats Java code using Eclipse Formatter!footnote:[I wanted to offer both Google Java Format and Eclipse but Google Java Format even on API level link:https://github.com/google/google-java-format/issues/1276[seems to have] no consistent ability to ignore lines.] but by default does not mess with JBang directives like `//DEPS` or the `///usr/bin/env` lines.

In its simplest form you just do:

`jbang-fmt .`

And it will format all the Java files recursively in the current directory.

If you want to format specific set of files and directories you can do:

`jbang-fmt myscript.java src/main`

That's it - you don't need to read more, just install it and use it.

## Installation

`jbang app install jbang-fmt@jbangdev/jbang-fmt`

## One more thing...

Since I made this in like 30 minutes as I was being https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang/pull/2205/[nerd sniped] I couldn't resist adding a few more bell and whistles.

Before I show them - please know - that I really highly recommend you use *one* format in your project and in many ways I fully agree with https://github.com/google/google-java-format/wiki/FAQ#i-just-need-to-configure-it-a-bit-differently-how[google-java-format faq] on locking down the formatting rules.

That said - the world is a messy place and we all have different needs - so I like to make formatting easy to do and enable easy experimentation - so I added all the ways I can think of a simple formatting tool could be useful.

### `--check`

This is a really simple flag that will check if the code is formatted without making any changes.

`jbang-fmt --check .`

If the code is not formatted it will exit with a non-zero code. Useful in CI pipelines to fail the build if the code is not formatted and as git pre-commit hooks. See https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-fmt/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml[ci.yml] for an example.

### Maven and Gradle integration

You can use it from Maven and Gradle using their jbang support - no additional plugins needed. See https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-fmt?tab=readme-ov-file#maven-integration[Maven] and https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-fmt?tab=readme-ov-file#gradle-integration[Gradle] in documentation for more details.

### Shortcuts for common "debates"

- **Tabs vs spaces?** Use `--indent-with=tab` or `--indent-with=space`
- **Big vs small monitor?** Use `--line-length=120` or `--line-length=40`
- **Java version nostalgia?** Use `--java-version=4` for the good old days or `--java-version=25` for living on the edge
- **Compact docs?** Use `--indent-size=2`
etc.

...and if you want full control you can use `-Skey=val` to override any Eclipse formatter property.

But again, remember I told you to just use one format - above is not meant to be used unless you are ready for war.

In addition it also supports using @-files in case you ignored my advice and want to go crazy on shared formatting.

### Conclusion

So - what are you waiting for? Install it and start formatting your code today!
