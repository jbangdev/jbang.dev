That is real Java. With real Maven dependencies. Running in your browser.

== What This Actually Is

**JBang-powered Java, running in Jupyter notebooks and webpages** — using Python's existing infrastructure (Binder, Thebe).

Here is what works right now:

* *https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter-java/jupyter-java-binder/jbang?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fjbangdev%252Fjbang-jupyter-examples%26urlpath%3Dlab%252Ftree%252Fcontent%252F%26branch%3Dmain%26targetPath%3Dcontent[Click to run Java in Binder]* — Full Java + JBang environment, zero setup
* *"Run with JBang" badges* — Add to any `.java` file or gist for instant browser execution
* *Runnable blog snippets* — Like the demo above, powered by Thebe
* *Jupyter notebooks with JBang directives* — Real `//DEPS`, real libraries, real Java

[source,java]
----
//DEPS com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.12.0
// Use OkHttp, Gson, Jackson, whatever - just like JBang on your machine
----

No Docker. No account. No JDK install.
Just Java you can *share* with a link.

== What This Unlocks

*Instant workshops* — A browser tab replaces a 45-minute install session.

*Runnable documentation* — Stop making readers imagine the output. Let them press Run.

*Shareable bug reproductions* — "Can you reproduce this?" becomes a link, not a setup guide.

*API exploration* — Test a library with `//DEPS`, not `pom.xml`.

This is not about data science or competing with Python.

This is about making Java something you can share with zero friction — the same mission JBang has always had.

== How We Got Here — Hitching a Ride on Python's Roads

image:/assets/images/java-you-can-share.png[width=50%]

For years, the Java instinct has been: build our own notebooks, our own clouds, our own hosted playgrounds.

But Python already _built the roads_ — Jupyter, Binder, Thebe.

And those platforms? They do not actually care what language you run.

So I stopped trying to compete with Python's ecosystem.
I asked a different question:

> **What if Java could quietly travel the same roads?**

No new infrastructure. No new service.
Just Java, standing on the shoulders of Python's ecosystem.

== The Technical Bits — For Those Who Want Details

=== JBang-Powered Java Kernel

Built on https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-jupyter[JBang Jupyter Kernel] (based on JJava, a fork of IJava).

It enables the same `//DEPS` syntax as JBang scripts:

[source,java]
----
//DEPS com.squareup.okio:okio:3.4.0
System.out.println("Full JVM ecosystem in a notebook cell");
----

This is not a sandboxed toy. Not "Java-like".
Real Java. Real libraries. Full JVM access.

If you can import libraries on the fly, you have not just added Java — you have brought the entire ecosystem with you.

=== Binder — Free Temporary Environments

MyBinder.org spins up containers with Java + JBang preconfigured.

Sessions are temporary. Resources are small. Everything resets.

And that is *perfect* — because this is not about deployment.

> Think *notebook*, not *platform*.  
> Think *prototype*, not *product*.  
> Think *demo*, not *server*.

If people fall in love with what they try here, they will install Java *by choice*.

=== Thebe — JavaScript Glue for Runnable Content

Thebe connects webpage code blocks to a Jupyter kernel (via Binder).

Same tech that powers interactive Python docs. Now it works with Java.

== Why This Matters — Java You Can Share

Java has defended its place in production for decades.

But *trying* Java? That has always been the problem.

> _"Download a JDK, configure JAVA_HOME, pick Maven or Gradle…"_

Meanwhile, Python users opened a browser tab and accidentally trained a neural network before breakfast.

It is not that Java could not do the same.
It is that Java was never *inviting* itself to the same places.

This work is about changing that:

**Making Java a language you can _share_ — instantly.**

No installer. No IDE war. No barrier.
Just code, curiosity, and a button.

> Most people never disliked Java.  
> They disliked the ceremony required to *meet* it.

=== Want In?

If you want to see Java show up in classrooms, blogs, notebooks, exploratory tools…
you are exactly who I built this for.
