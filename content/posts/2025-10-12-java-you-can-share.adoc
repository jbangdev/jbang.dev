JBang is about making Java something you can edit, build, run, deploy and share with minimum ceremony and optimally zero friction. This is a work in progress, and this week I feel we got a big step closer to the ultimate goal. Best way to show this? Just try it yourself - it takes 5 seconds.

== Try Java in your browser

Click this link → link:/try/?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjbangdev%2Fjbang-jupyter-examples&filepath=hibernate.ipynb[Run Java in your browser] - wait a moment and you have a running Java environment,
showing Hibernate example in your browser. No JDK or IDE to install, no account, just works.

Or scroll down and click "Activate" below to run Java code right here in this blog post:

That is real Java. With real Maven dependencies. Output rendered in your browser with no additional install.

For those curious - above is using https://github.com/jeamlit/jeamlit[Jeamlit] to render the chart in your browser.
Jeamlit is a new library similar to Steamlit for Python but inspired by JBang to allows building interactive web apps in Java with zero friction - do try it out!

== What was made

I've been wanting to use `//DEPS` in Jupyter Notebooks for a long time, but it has been a pain to set up, so I 
talked with maintainers of JJava and Raipaio kernels and explored options. 

And in doing so I discovered that we could use Python's existing infrastructure (Jupyter Notebooks, MyBinder and Thebe) to make this all work.

There is a shockingly small amount of code to make this all work - and its in its infancy still; but I'm sure you all will want to use and 
possibly contribute to it.

Here are what are currently done:

* Created a custom https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-jupyter-kernel[JBang Jupyter kernel] that supports `//DEPS` directives in notebooks
* Built a https://github.com/jupyter-java/jupyter-java-binder[Binder environment] for running Java kernels in your browser with no install
* Developed https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-jupyter-runner[jbang-jupyter-runner] extension to run .java/.jsh files directly in Jupyter Lab

Put it all together and you have a way to run Java code in your browser with no additional install.

**Note:** This is not just for browser-based notebooks - it also works in IntelliJ, VSCode, Cursor and other IDEs that support Jupyter Notebooks.

== How to Try It

The fastest way is our new link:/try/[jbang.dev/try] page.

**In your browser (no install):**

* Click link:/try/?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjbangdev%2Fjbang-jupyter-examples&filepath=hibernate.ipynb[this Hibernate example]
* Try link:/try/?code=IO.println%28%22Hello%20from%20JBang%21%22%29%3B[custom code]
* Build link:/try/custom/[your own shareable links] for your repositories

**Locally (with Jupyter):**

[source,bash]
----
jbang install-kernel@jupyter-java --java 25 --enable-preview jbang
----

Works in IntelliJ, VSCode, Cursor, and any IDE with Jupyter support! If not - let us know!

== What This Unlocks

*Instant workshops* — A browser tab replaces a 45-minute install session.

*Runnable documentation* — Stop making readers imagine the output. Let them press Run.

*Shareable bug reproductions* — "Can you reproduce this?" becomes a link, not a setup guide.

*API exploration* — Test a library with `//DEPS`, not `pom.xml`.

This is not about data science or competing with Python.

This is about making Java something you can share with zero friction — all in line with JBang's mission.

== Try It Now

This is still new and evolving - we'd love your feedback!

**Get started:**

* Try the link:/try/[interactive demo] right now
* Create link:/try/custom/[custom shareable links] for your projects
* Install locally: `jbang install-kernel@jupyter-java --java 25 --enable-preview jbang`

This is about making Java something you can share with zero friction — all in line with JBang's mission.

Share your creations with #jbang on social media - we'd love to see what you build!
