JBang is about making Java something you can edit, build, run, deploy and share with  minimum ceremony and optimally zero friction. This is a work in progress, and this week I feel we got a big step closer to the ultimate goal. I'm not sure how to best explain this, so I'll just show you.

== Try Java in your browser

Click this link → link:/try/?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjbangdev%2Fjbang-jupyter-examples&filepath=hibernate.ipynb[Run Java in your browser] - wait a moment and you have a running Java environment,
showing Hibernate example in your browser. No JDK or IDE to install, no account, just works.

Or scroll down and click "Activate" below to run Java code right here in this blog post:

That is real Java. With real Maven dependencies. Output rendered in your browser with no additional install.

For those curious - above is using https://github.com/jeamlit/jeamlit[Jeamlit] to render the chart in your browser.
Jeamlit is a new library similar to Steamlit for Python but inspired by JBang to allows building interactive web apps in Java with zero friction - do try it out!

== What was made

I've been wanting to use `//DEPS` in Jupyter Notebooks for a long time, but it has been a pain to set up, so I 
talked with maintainers of JJava and Raipaio kernels and explored options. 

And in doing so I discovered that we could use Python's existing infrastructure (Jupyter Notebooks, MyBinder and Thebe) to make this all work.

There is a shockingly small amount of code to make this all work - and its in its infancy still; but I'm sure you all will want to use and 
possibly contribute to it.

Here are what are currently done:

* Made a custom  https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-jupyter-kernel[JBang kernel], for Jupyter Notebooks that allows you to use `//DEPS` directives to add dependencies to your notebook. 
* On Jupyter Java, we made a  https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-jupyter-kernel[Binder environment] that allows you to run any of the supported Java kernels in your browser with no additional install.
* Created a custom Jupyter Extension, https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-jupyter-runner[jbang-jupyter-runner], that lets you run any .java/.jsh file in Jupyter Lab. Not just via notebooks.

Put it all together and you have a way to run Java code in your browser with no additional install.

p.s. this is not just for browser based noteboks - it also works in IntelliJ, VSCode, Cursor and other IDEs that support Jupyter Notebooks.

## How to try it out

The easiest is the new link:/try/[jbang.dev/try] page.

link:/try/[jbang.dev/try] now uses this infrastructure to run Java code in your browser with no additional install.

You can make the code it load custom http://localhost:8080/try/?code=IO.println%28%22From+Blog%21%22%29%3B[code] to try!

You can even build link:/try/custom/[custom lyour own repositories to share with your friends and colleagues.

If you want to try it out locally you can install the JBang kernel and use it in your favourite Jupyter notebook editor:

```bash
jbang install-kernel@jupyter-java --java 25 --enable-preview jbang
```

Then just configure your favourite Jupyter notebook editor to use the JBang kernel.

== What This Unlocks

*Instant workshops* — A browser tab replaces a 45-minute install session.

*Runnable documentation* — Stop making readers imagine the output. Let them press Run.

*Shareable bug reproductions* — "Can you reproduce this?" becomes a link, not a setup guide.

*API exploration* — Test a library with `//DEPS`, not `pom.xml`.

This is not about data science or competing with Python.

This is about making Java something you can share with zero friction — all in line with JBang's mission.

== Making Java Shareable

This is still new but come and try it out and let us know what you think!
