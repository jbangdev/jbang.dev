Today we are announcing https://github.com/jbang-npm[jbang-npm] a npm package which brings you Java Script to your JavaScript project.

`jbang-npm` joins `https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-maven[jbang-maven]` and `https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-gradle[jbang-gradle]` as tools that brings the power of Java Script to your favourite build setup.

`jbang-npm` supports running any kind java code that JBang supports.

Wether that is a script from the https://jbang.dev/appstore[AppStore], a Maven GAV, a jar or simply a java file stored in your project.

== Example

Given you have a script name `test.js`:

[source,javascript]
----
#! /usr/bin/env node
const jbang = require('@jbangdev/jbang');
jbang.exec('--java 18', 'properties@jbangdev', 'java');
jbang.exec('hello.java', '"Java Script"')
----

And in `package.json`:

[source,json]
----
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "node test.js"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@jbangdev/jbang": "^0.1.4"
  }
}
----

With a `hello.java` that contains:

[source,java]
----
//DEPS com.github.lalyos:jfiglet:0.0.8

import com.github.lalyos.jfiglet.FigletFont;

class hello {

    public static void main(String... args) throws Exception {
        System.out.println(FigletFont.convertOneLine(
               "Hello " + ((args.length>0)?args[0]:"jbang")));  ;;
    }
}
----

When you run this using `npm run test` it will automatically install JBang and Java if necessary and you get an output like:

In this case JBang was already installed but it did go transparently and downloaded Java 18 as one of the scripts was called with `--java 18`.

The opportunities are endless!

`jbang-npm` was contributed by Peter Thomas and Pallafor Yodis from https://karatelabs.github.io/karate/[Karate] hall of fame. 

Very much appreciated and looking forward to see what you make happen with Java Script in your JavaScript!

Have fun!
